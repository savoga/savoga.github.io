**Probabilistic theory**

Objectivism: the probability of an event is determined in a unique
manner.

Subjectivism: the probability of an event is not determined in a unique
manner.

Bayesianism is a probabilistic theory part of the subjectivism. It
states that a probability varies depending on new information (Bayes
theorem).

In Bayesian inference, random variables are $X$. $\theta$ is not random
and not known. The objective is to estimate $\theta$ using
*a-posteriori* probabilities.
