I""<p><strong>Probabilistic Theory</strong></p>

<p>Objectivism: the probability of an event is determined in a unique
manner.</p>

<p>Subjectivism: the probability of an event is not determined in a unique
manner.</p>

<p>Bayesianism is a probabilistic theory part of the subjectivism. It
states that a probability varies depending on new information (Bayes
theorem).</p>

<p>In Bayesian inference, random variables are $X$. $\theta$ is not random
and not known. The objective is to estimate $\theta$ using
<em>a-posteriori</em> probabilities.</p>
