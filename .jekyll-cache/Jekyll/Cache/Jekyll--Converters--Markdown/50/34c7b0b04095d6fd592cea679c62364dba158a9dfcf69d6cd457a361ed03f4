<p>(see kmeans.pdf from OneDrive folders for more details)</p>

<p>Objective: group data into $k$ clusters so that samples in the same
cluster are close to each other w.r.t. the Euclidean distance.</p>

<p>The cost function minimization is written as such:</p>

\[\underset{C_1,...,C_k;\mu_1,...,\mu_k}{\operatorname{argmin}}\Sigma_{j=1}^k\Sigma_{i \in C_j}||x_i-\mu_j||^2\]

<p>Where $\mu_j$ is the mean, also called gravity center or cluster center:</p>

\[\mu_j=\frac{1}{|C_j|}\Sigma_{i \in C_j}x_i\]

<p>Input: $x_1,…,x_n$ Output: clusters $C_1,…,C_k$ Random values for
$\mu_1,…,\mu_k$ // Step 1: Update clusters
$C_1,…,C_k \leftarrow \emptyset$
$j \leftarrow argmin_l ||x_i - \mu_l||$ $C_j \leftarrow C_j + {i}$ //
We add observation $i$ to the cluster $C_j$ // Step 2: Update cluster
centers $\mu_j \leftarrow 0$ $n_j \leftarrow 0$ // We loop on all
observations of each cluster $\mu_j \leftarrow \mu_j + x_i$
$n_j \leftarrow n_j +1$ $\mu_j \leftarrow \mu_j /n_j$</p>

<p>The quality of the clustering strongly depends on the initial center
values. This is why the algorithm is generally run multiple times for
different initial values. The best clustering (i.e., that of minimum
cost) is returned.</p>

<p>[K-means++]{.underline}</p>

<p>To improve the quality of the clustering, we choose the initial cluster
centers far from each other:</p>

<p>- select the first cluster center uniformly at random among the n data
samples</p>

<p>- select the following cluster centers at random, with a probability
proportional to the square distance to the closest current cluster
center</p>

centers.append(X[np.random.randint(X.shape[0])]) # inital center = one random sample
distance = np.full(X.shape[0], np.inf) # a vector (n,1) with only infinity terms
for j in range(1,self.n_clusters):
    distance = np.minimum(np.linalg.norm(X - centers[-1], axis=1), distance) # size (n,1); 
# distance = the smallest distance associated with 
# the last added center
    p = np.square(distance) / np.sum(np.square(distance)) # probability vector [p1,...,pn]
# the highest probability in p is associated 
# with the biggest distance w.r.t the last added center
    sample = np.random.choice(X.shape[0], p = p) # one sample is 
                         # selected according to probabilities

<p>[Note: this problem is called <em>NP-hard problem</em>. It means that its
complexity is at least equal to the complexity of an
NP-problem]{style=”color: gray”}</p>

<p>[NP-problem: a problem is NP if it can be determined by a
non-deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time. Intuitively, a
problem is NP if we can quickly verify if one candidate is a solution of
the problem. E.g. "travelling salesman problem" = let $d$ be a
distance and $n$ be a number of cities. Is there an itinerary with
distance $\ge d$ stopping by every city? -&gt; easy to
check...]{style=”color: gray”}</p>
