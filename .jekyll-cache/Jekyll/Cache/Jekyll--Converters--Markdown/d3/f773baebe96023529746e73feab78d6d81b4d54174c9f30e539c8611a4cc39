I"è<p>Unsupervised learning aims at <strong>learning some underlying hidden
structure of the data when we donâ€™t have the labels</strong>.</p>

<p>Unsupervised models can be used as a pre step for supervised learning,
e.g.:</p>

<p>- reduce the training sample (dimensionality reduction: forward
selection, PCA, autoencoders)</p>

<p>- give output for unlabeled data (clustering, autoencoders)</p>

<p>- grow the training sample (generative models? autoencoders?
variational encoders?)</p>
